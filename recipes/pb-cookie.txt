Prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray down with non-stick spray and set aside.","ingredient":[]},{"description":"In a large enough bowl to hold the full recipe, whisk dry ingredients together. Then, add peanut butter to dry ingredients. Name brand is preferred as they typically have more emulsifiers that help in the baking process, natural peanut butters will be me oily. Using a clean hand, crumble/press the dry mixture and peanut butter together until you get a loose dough-like mixture similar in texture to wet sand.

Stir until combined. (Dough is very stiff)","ingredient":[]},{"description":"Roughly chop the bar of chocolate on a cutting board until you get loose, chip-sized pieces. The less consistent you are the better, as varying the size of the chocolate chunks helps improve the texture of the final cookie.

Using an ice cream scoop (or a kitchen spoon), scoop dough into roughly 16 equal cookies one at a time. For each scoop, use the scoop and one hand to form the dough into a ball. Roll the ball in sugar until covered. Place on a baking sheet (each sheet will have 8 cookies in 2x4 arrangement).","ingredient":[{"name":"White Sugar","amountOptions":["1/2 Cup"]}]},{"description":"Using the tines of a fork, press the cookies down until they are roughly half an inch tall. PB cookies tend to not spread out as much in baking, so they need help this way to cook evenly. This will also give the cookies the distinctive 'peanut butter cookie' pattern. Sprinkle the top of each cookie with a pinch or two of large, flaky sea salt.","ingredient":[]},{"description":"Place the baking sheets on two different oven racks.
